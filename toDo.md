# <u>Issues and Steps to Resolve Them</u>

Here are 5 issues that can be resolved in this code by someone at a React beginner level, along with the steps required to complete each task:

### Add functionality for adding new tasks:

1. Create a state variable in the Form component to store the list of tasks.
2. Implement an onChange event listener on the input field to update the value of a separate state variable to track the input field's value.
3. Implement an onSubmit event listener on the form that adds the new task to the task list state variable and clears the input field's value.
4. Update the rendering of the task list to display the dynamically generated tasks from the state variable.

### Implement functionality for editing and deleting tasks:

1. Create a state variable in the Form component to store the list of tasks.
2. Implement an onClick event listener on the "Edit" button that toggles the editable state of the corresponding task.
3. Implement an onChange event listener on the corresponding task's input field to update the value of the task.
4. Implement an onClick event listener on the "Delete" button that removes the corresponding task from the task list state variable.
5. Update the rendering of the task list to display the dynamically generated tasks from the state variable.

### Render the tasks dynamically based on the data fetched from the API:

1. Create a state variable in the Form component to store the list of tasks.
2. Use the fetch() method to fetch the list of tasks from the API and update the task list state variable with the fetched data.
3. Update the rendering of the task list to display the dynamically generated tasks from the state variable.

### Add error handling for the fetch() method to handle cases where the API is not reachable or returns an error response:

1. Implement a try/catch block around the fetch() method.
2. In the catch block, update the state variable with an error message to display to the user.

### Refactor the component to make it more modular and reusable:

1. Create a separate component for the individual tasks.
2. Pass the task data as props to the task component.
3. Create a separate component for the task list.
4. Pass the task data as props to the task list component.
5. Update the Form component to render the task list component.
